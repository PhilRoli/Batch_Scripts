# **Batch_Scripts**

Just some Scripts I made that help me in stuff I have to do often and dont want to do by hand all the time.
Below you will find a list with explination to nearly all files in this repo.

Dont know if anyone will find this usefull, but I thought I would make it my first public repo.
Also please ignore my mixture of English and German in certain files.

## Files

- **checkprogramm.bat**: Ask for user input of a certain programm, which then gets checked if it is running, if so user gets asked if he wants to kill it.
